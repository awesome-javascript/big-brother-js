         <p>Compressed and uncompressed copies of BigBrother.js files are available. The uncompressed file is best used
            during development or debugging; the compressed file saves bandwidth and improves performance in production.
            You can also download a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">sourcemap
               file</a> for use when debugging with a compressed file. The map file is not required for users to run
            BigBrother.js, it just improves the developer's debugger experience.</p>
